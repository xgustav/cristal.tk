## Design REST APIs with OpenAPI Specification

Stoplight provides API design tools for anyone building enterprise APIs. Use the OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger) with Stoplight’s visual editor to design consistent and standardized REST APIs for your organization. Our tools can make your OpenAPI Specification the single source of truth within your organization. You don’t need to be an OpenAPI expert to create first-class API designs. No code is required when using the schema designer. Model complex APIs faster than ever before, increasing engineering bandwidth and saving valuable time. Hosted mock servers allow your organization to design APIs and receive feedback on API prototypes simultaneously.

## Collaborative API Design

With Stoplight’s enterprise API Design tool, organizations can collaboratively build APIs. API mocking, powered by Prism, allows backend and frontend engineerings teams to work in tandem building APIs, increasing efficiency and saving valuable engineering time. Auto-generated documentation allows you to share your API prototype in human-readable format. Discussions allow members within your organization to comment on API designs and documentation, increasing organization-wide communication.

Shared models and properties reduce duplication and promote reuse of data models within an organization. Custom style and validation rules give you control over API governance to make sure your API designs match your organizations own unique API style guides.

## On-premise Web API Design Tools

Stoplight offers various API design tooling service options. You can use the hosted Stoplight web app, desktop app for Mac, Windows, and Linux, or various on-premise solutions. Our mock servers, powered by Prism, are also available to be run on the command line, a URL, or as a Docker container.

Stoplight will find a solution that works for your development stack, security requirements, and engineering workflow so that you can design APIs on your enterprise’s infrastructure.

## Consistent Enterprise APIs That Meet Business Goals

The full API lifecycle must be tied to specific business goals. Your API is a product within your whole business offering. Some questions to consider before designing your API: Why are you designing that API? What business goals is it contributing to? What customer pain point does it solve? Good design-first APIs start with defining your value proposition and identifying the stakeholders that it matters to. Then the API design can help you achieve these goals.

Stoplight empowers large organizations to build more standardized and consistent APIs. Designing, testing, and documenting web APIs through the platform can help ensure you meet critical business goals, industry, and regulatory requirements. Designing APIs in Stoplight can ensure APIs are built the way they are designed and meet the requirements of stakeholders.
