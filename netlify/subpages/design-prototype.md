## Use OpenAPI Specification to Prototype APIs

Stoplight provides web API tooling that kicks off the API development process with quick API prototyping. The visual API editor allows you to quickly specify your APIs’ endpoints, models, properties, and much more using the OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger).

Think of the OpenAPI Specification as a prototype documentation template. It helps you create your REST API design prototype in human and machine-readable format. Describe endpoints, headers, bodies, multiple responses, query string parameters, shared models, and much more. You don’t have to think about what information you need to fill out. It is all there for you.

## Visual API Design

It can be hard to write JSON or YAML in a specification language you don’t really know. Stoplight’s visual editor doesn’t require you to be an OpenAPI expert to design APIs for your APIs. Model complex APIs faster than ever before. No code is required when using the schema designer, so you can focus on your design and less on HTTP.

## Design-First APIs

Don’t waste your time building APIs with a costly code first approach. Start with a design first approach that saves you time, money, and engineering resources down the road. When you use Stoplight to create your API design prototype, you gain auto-generated documentation, hosted mock servers, and style linting and governance that ensures you are building an API that meets your specific business goals.

## Language Neutral API Designs

It doesn’t matter if you are developing your API in JavaScript, Python, Java, or any other programming language. API specifications, such as OpenAPI Specification, are a language neutral format for your API design prototype. Once you have decided on an API design, you can turn it into server stubs using a language specific library to help accelerate API development.
