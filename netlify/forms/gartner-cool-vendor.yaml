    Large enterprises embarking on Digital API transformation initiatives are
    increasingly relying on API Design Management platforms in addition to
    traditional API Management solutions to supercharge their business.<br>

    Poor API designs lead to poor service implementations and documentation
    which can slow down service delivery and negatively impact the ROI of the
    initiative.<br>


    We believe this is why _Gartner_ named _Stoplight_ a **Cool Vendor in
    Application Development and Platforms.** This report highlights
    _Stoplight’s_ API Design Management platform.<br><br>


    ### API Design


    Model, collaborate, and automate - don’t manually manage thousands of lines
    of API spec using a text editor. _Stoplight’s_ extensible visual modeling
    technology is central to the _Stoplight_ platform which has purpose-built
    automation for OpenAPI (fka Swagger) and JSON Schema specifications backed
    by git.<br><br>


    ### API Collaboration


    Collaborate, share, and validate your API Designs. Leverage best practices
    quickly, share common API artifacts easily, and report on API Style Guide
    adoption across the organization.<br><br>


    ### API Testing


    Automate your contract testing.  Ensure that your API Design and your
    implementation are in synch.<br><br>


    ### API Documentation


    Automatic indexing of your API Designs ensures all of your documentation is
    up to date.  In addition, a cross organizational “API Design Catalog” is
    auto-generated for quick and efficient searching of API Design
    artifacts.<br><br>

        We decided to go for Stoplight because we are convinced that the API
        must be held by the business people (product owners). Before, they were
        used to designing processes or UI screens. Now, the screens are made by
        UX experts or by fintechs using our APIs. So, the product owners have to
        design the API, it's an important change, not all of them are ready.
        This is why a graphical tools is a good opportunity, perhaps the only
        one, to involve them in the design of API.
