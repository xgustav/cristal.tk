        We were previously using something like Swagger-UI but Stoplight allowed
        our developers to interact with other services from other teams and
        developers without too much effort. That was something that really made
        Stoplight special.

## Hudya’s Hazards

Hudya ideally wanted to have all of their API service built and managed in a single centralized platform. They were experiencing issues managing a large amount of specifications for their services and the corresponding documentation and they worried that merging all these files down the road would be painful and unsustainable. They also wanted to convert to a design-first philosophy and have collaborative tooling to assist them in managing multiple services assigned to separate teams and developers.

## The Stoplight Strategy

Stoplight provided Hudya with a single source of truth for their API development. Hudya could manage their Teams, Developers, all their service’s specifications, and the corresponding documentation within Stoplight. Stoplight also helped them promote a design-first philosophy by providing Contract Validation and Contract Testing, two key features that require a design-first approach.
